## Introduction
I was always a fun of heigh quality DVB receivers like ASTON xena series. GUI in those receivers was impressive and even 20 years later it is still better tha most of the actual GUI in the most advanced linux STBs of nowdays.
this is an example of how GUI looks like in an STB 20 years ago.
